                <h4>Coronavirus pandemic likely to be 'lengthy', WHO warns.</h4>
                  <p>The World Health Organization warned the coronavirus pandemic was likely to be "lengthy" as it met to evaluate the situation, six months after sounding the international alarm. The WHO emergency committee <b>highlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of this COVID-19 pandemic</b> when it met on Friday, the WHO said in a statement, warning of "the risk of response fatigue in the context of socio-economic pressures".</p></li>

                <h4>Africaâ€™s COVID-19 infections fast approaching the one million mark.</h4>
                <p>The number of COVID-19 infections in Africa is fast approaching the one million mark as countries report a steady spike in new cases. As of Sunday evening, the continent had reported 929,696 cases, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. </p>

                <h4>Is Turkmenistan really coronavirus-free?</h4>
                <p>Turkmenistan is one of a handful of countries that has not reported a single coronavirus case during the global pandemic. Despite neighbouring Central Asian countries including Iran, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan all battling COVID-19, Turkmenistan has so far only acknowledged the presence of pneumonia. Some critics are doubtful of the government's coronavirus-free claim and say its continued denial is risking the health of Turkmen citizens. Human rights advocates outside of Turkmenistan allege that medical workers have been silenced when it comes to the pandemic. </p></li>

                <h4>Is the world facing a second coronavirus wave?</h4>
                <p>Just a few weeks ago, many countries thought they had the coronavirus under control as the number of cases was falling and the curve of infections flattening. Governments started lifting restrictions and reopening their economies. Some were even praised for their successes and many people resumed their daily lives. But that optimism has not lasted. A sudden record number of infections is being reported in many countries. Some call it a resurgence, others a comeback. And scientists are debating how to identify and define what a "second wave" is.</p></li>
